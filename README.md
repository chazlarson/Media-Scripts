# Media-Scripts

Misc scripts and tools. Undocumented scripts probably do what I need them to but aren't finished yet.

## Requirements

1. A system that can run Python 3.7 [or newer]
1. Python 3.7 [or newer] installed on that system

   One of the requirements of these scripts is alive-progress 2.4.1, which requires Python 3.7.

1. A basic knowledge of how to run Python scripts.

## Setup

## if you use [`direnv`](https://github.com/direnv/direnv):
1. clone the repo
1. cd into the repo dir
1. run `direnv allow` as the prompt will tell you to
1. direnv will build the virtual env and keep requirements up to date

## if you don't use [`direnv`](https://github.com/direnv/direnv):
1. install direnv
2. go to the previous section
   
ok no

1. clone repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts.git
   ```
1. cd to repo directory
   ```
   cd Media-Scripts
   ```
1. Install requirements with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` [I'd suggest doing this in a virtual environment]
   
   Creating a virtual environment is described [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html); there's also a step-by-step in the local walkthrough in the Plex-Meta-Manager wiki.
1. cd to script directory [`Plex`, `Plex-Meta-Manager`, `TMDB`, etc]
   for example:
   ```
   cd Plex
   ```
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   Linux or Mac:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Windows:
   ```
   copy .env.example .env
   ```  
1. Edit .env to suit your environment [plex url, token, libraries] and your requirements [what to do, where to download things, etc.]; the settings for each script are detailed in the readme within each folder as shown below.
   Edit the file with whatever text editor you wish.
1. Run the desired script.


All these scripts use the same `.env` and requirements.
