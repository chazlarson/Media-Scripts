# Plex scripts

Misc scripts and tools. Undocumented scripts probably do what I need them to but aren't finished yet.

## Setup

See the top-level [README](../README.md) for setup instructions.

All these scripts use the same `.env` and requirements.

NOTE: on 06-29 these scripts have changed to using ENV vars to set up the Plex API details.  This was done primarily to enable the timeout to apply to all Plex interactions.

If your `.env` file contains the original `PLEX_URL` and `PLEX_TOKEN` entries those will be silently changed for you.

### `.env` contents

## adjust-added-dates.py

You have things in your library that show up added in the future, or way in the past.

This script will set the "added at" date and "originally available" date to match the thing's release date as found on TMDB, if the values set in Plex are more than a day or so off the TMDB release date.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```
ADJUST_DATE_FUTURES_ONLY=0      # Only look at items that show up as added in the future
ADJUST_DATE_EPOCH_ONLY=1        # Only adjust items that have "originally available" dates of `1970-01-01`
```

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python adjust-added-dates.py`


## user-emails.py

You want a list of email addresses for all the people you share with.

Here is a quick and dirty [emphasis on "quick" and "dirty"] way to do that.

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python user-emails.py`

The script will loop through all the shared users on your account and spit out username and email address.

```shell
connecting...
getting users...
looping over 26 users...
binguser - bing@gmail.com
mrbang - bang@gmail.com
boingster - boing@gmail.com
...
```

## reset-posters-tmdb.py

Perhaps you want to reset all the posters in a library

This script will set the poster for every series or movie to the default poster from TMDB/TVDB.  It also saves that poster under `./posters/[movies|shows]/<rating_key>.ext` in case you want to use them with PMM's overlay resets.

If there is a file already located at `./posters/[movies|shows]/<rating_key>.ext`, the script will use *that image* instead of retrieving a new one, so if you replace that local one with a poster of your choice, the script will use the custom one rather than the TMDB/TVDB default.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```shell
TRACK_RESET_STATUS=1                            # pick up where the script left off
LOCAL_RESET_ARCHIVE=1                           # keep a local archive of posters
TARGET_LABELS = Bing, Bang, Boing               # reset artwork on items with these labels
REMOVE_LABELS=1                                 # remove labels when done [NOT RECOMMENDED]
RESET_SEASONS=1                                 # reset-posters-plex resets season artwork as well in TV libraries
RESET_EPISODES=1                                # reset-posters-plex resets episode artwork as well in TV libraries [requires RESET_SEASONS=True]
RETAIN_RESET_STATUS_FILE=0                      # Don't delete the reset progress file at the end
DRY_RUN=0                                       # [currently only works with reset-posters-*]; don't actually do anything, just log
FLUSH_STATUS_AT_START=0                         # Delete the reset progress file at the start instead of reading them
RESET_SEASONS_WITH_SERIES=0                     # If there isn't a season poster, use the series poster
```

If you set:
```
TRACK_RESET_STATUS=1
```
The script will keep track of where it is and will pick up at that point on subsequent runs.  This is useful in the event of a lost connection to Plex.

Once it gets to the end of the library successfully, the tracking file is deleted.  If you want to disable that for some reason, set `RETAIN_RESET_STATUS_FILE` to 1

If you want to reset any existing progress tracking and start from the beginning for some reason, set `FLUSH_STATUS_AT_START` to 1.

If you specify a comma-separated list of labels in the env file:
```
TARGET_LABELS = This label, That label, Another label
```
The script will reset posters only on movies with those labels assigned.

If you also set:
```
REMOVE_LABELS=1
```
The script will *attempt* to remove those labels after resetting the poster.  I say "attempt" since in testing I have experienced an odd situation where no error occurs but the label is not removed.  My test library of 230 4K-Dolby Movies contains 47 that fail in this way; every run it goes through the 47 movies "removing labels" without error yet they still have the labels on the next run.

Besides that Heisenbug, I don't recommend using this [`REMOVE_LABELS`] since the label removal takes a long time [dozens of seconds per item].  Doing this through the Plex UI is much faster.

If you set:
```
LOCAL_RESET_ARCHIVE=0
```
The script will set the artwork by sending the TMDB URL to Plex, without downloading the file locally first.  This means a faster run compared to the initial run when downloading.

Example timings on a test library of 1140 TV Shows, resetting artwork for Show-Season-Episode level:

1. No downloading: 1 hour 25 minutes
1. With downloading: 2 hours 30 minutes
2. Second run with downloaded archive: 1 hours 10 minutes

That is on a system with a 1G connection up and down, so values are just relative to each other.

The value of the local archive is that if you want to replace some of those images with your own, it provides a simple way to update all the posters in a library to custom posters of your own.  When the script runs, it looks at that archive first, only downloading an image if one doesn't exist in the archive.

In that way it's sort of like PMM's Asset Directory.

If you're just looking to reset as a one-off, that may not have value.

If no artwork is found at TMDB for a thing, no action is taken.

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python reset-posters-tmdb.py`

```
tmdb config...
connecting to https://stream.BING.BANG...
getting items from [TV Shows - 4K]...
looping over 876 items...
[=---------------------------------------] 2.7% ... Age of Big Cats
```

At this time, there is no configuration aside from library name; it replaces all posters.  It does not delete any posters from Plex, just grabs a URL and uses the API to set the poster to the URL.

## reset-posters-plex.py

Script-specific variables in .env:
```
TRACK_RESET_STATUS=1                            # pick up where the script left off
LOCAL_RESET_ARCHIVE=1                           # keep a local archive of posters
TARGET_LABELS = Bing, Bang, Boing               # reset artwork on items with these labels
REMOVE_LABELS=1                                 # remove labels when done [NOT RECOMMENDED]
RESET_SEASONS=1                                 # reset-posters-plex resets season artwork as well in TV libraries
RESET_EPISODES=1                                # reset-posters-plex resets episode artwork as well in TV libraries [requires RESET_SEASONS=True]
RETAIN_RESET_STATUS_FILE=0                      # Don't delete the reset progress file at the end
DRY_RUN=0                                       # [currently only works with reset-posters-*]; don't actually do anything, just log
FLUSH_STATUS_AT_START=0                         # Delete the reset progress file at the start instead of reading them
RESET_SEASONS_WITH_SERIES=0                     # If there isn't a season poster, use the series poster
```

Same as `reset-posters-tmdb.py`, but it resets the artwork to the first item in Plex's own list of artwork, rather than downloading a new image from TMDB.

With `RESET_SEASONS_WITH_SERIES=1`, if the season doesn't have artwork the series artwork will be used instead.

## grab-all-IDs.py

Perhaps you want to gather all the IDs for everything in a library.

This script will go through a library and grab PLex RatingKey [which may be unique], IMDB ID, TMDB ID, and TVDB ID for everything in the list of libraries specified in the `.env`.  It stores the data in a sqlite database called `ids.sqlite`; the repo copy of this file contains that data for 105871 movies and 26699 TV Shows.


## grab-all-posters.py

Perhaps you want to get local copies of some or all the posters Plex knows about for everything in a library.

Maybe you find it easier to look through a bunch of options in CoverFlow or something.

Maybe you want to grab all the current custom art in a library to put in a PMM asset directory or back it up for some other purpose.

This script will download some or all the posters for every item in a given set of libraries.  It (probably) won't download the same thing more than once, so you can cancel it and restart it if need be.  I say "probably" because the script is assuming that the list of posters retrieved from Plex is always in the same order [i.e. that new posters get appended to the end of the list].  On subsequent runs, the script checks only that a target file exists.  It doesn't pay any attention to whether the two [the one on disk vs. the one coming from Plex] are the same image.  I'll probably add a check to look at the image URL to attempt to ameliorate this at some point.

The script can name these files so that they are ready for use with [Plex-Meta-Manager's Asset Directory](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/home/guides/assets.html).  This only works with `ONLY_CURRENT` set, since PMM has no provision for multiple assets for a given thing.

If you have downloaded more than one image for each thing, see [image_picker.py](#image_pickerpy) for a simpler way to choose which one you want to make active.

If `THREADED_DOWNLOADS=1`, the script queues downloads so they happen in the background in multiple threads.  Once it's gone through the libraries listed in the config, it will then wait until the queue is drained before exiting.  If you want to drop out of the library-scanning loop early, create a file `stop.dat` next to the script, and the library loop will exit at the end of the current show or movie, then go to the "waiting for the downloads" section.  This allows you to get out early without flushing the queue [as control-C would do].

You can also skip the current library by creating `skip.dat`.

The point of "POSTER_DEPTH" is that sometimes movies have an insane number of posters, and maybe you don't want all 257 Endgame posters or whatever.  Or maybe you want to download them in batches.

If "POSTER_DOWNLOAD" is `0`, the script will build a shell/batch script for each library to download the images at your convenience instead of downloading them as it runs, so you can run the downloads overnight or on a different machine with ALL THE DISK SPACE or something.

If "POSTER_CONSOLIDATE" is `1`, the script will store all the images in one directory rather than separating them by library name.  The idea is that Plex shows the same set of posters for "Star Wars" whether it's in your "Movies" or "Movies - 4K" or whatever other libraries, so there's no reason to pull the same set of posters multiple times.  There is an example below.

If "INCLUDE_COLLECTION_ARTWORK" is `1`, the script will grab artwork for all the collections in the target library.

If "ONLY_COLLECTION_ARTWORK" is `1`, the script will grab artwork for ONLY the collections in the target library; artwork for individual items [movies, shows] will not be grabbed.

If "ONLY_THESE_COLLECTIONS" is not empty, the script will grab artwork for ONLY the collections listed and items contained in those collections.  This doesn't affect the sorting or naming, just the filter applied when asking Plex for the items.  IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THIS SETTING, NOTHING WILL BE DOWNLOADED.

If "TRACK_URLS" is `1`, the script will track every URL it downloads in a sqlite database.  On future runs, if a given URL is found in that database it won't be downloaded a second time.  This may save time if the same URL appears multiple times in the list of posters from Plex.

If "TRACK_COMPLETION" is `1`, the script records collections/movies/shows/seasons/episodes by rating key in a sqlite database.  On future runs, if a given rating key is found in that database the thing is considered complete and it will be skipped.  This will save time in subsequent runs as the script will not look through all the images for a thing only to determine that it's already downloaded all of them.  HOWEVER, this also means that if you increase `POSTER_DEPTH`, those additional images won't be picked up when you run the script again, since the item will be marked as complete.

The script keeps track of the last date it retrieved items from a library [for show libraries it also tracks seasons and episodes separately], and on each run will only retrieve items added since that date.  If there is no "last run date" for a given thing, the script uses a fallback "last run" date of today - `DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK`.

If `DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK` = 0, the fallback date is "the beginning of time".  There is one other circumstance that will result in a fallback date of "the beginning of time".

If:
1. You are running Windows
2. `DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK` is > 0
3. the calculated fallback date is before 01/01/1970

Then the "beginning of time" fallback date will be used.  This is a Windows issue.

Normally, this fallback date is used *only* if there is no last-run date stored, for example the first time you run the script.  This means that if you run the script once with `DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK=2` then change that to `DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK=0`, nothing new will be downloaded.  The script will read the last run date from its database and will never look at the new fallback date.

You can use `RESET_LIBRARIES` to force the "last run date" to that fallback date for one or more libraries.  

If you want to reset all libraries and clear all history, delete `mediascripts.sqlite`.

For example:

You run `grab-all-posters` with `DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK=2`; it downloads posters for half your "Movies" library.  Now you want to grab all the rest.  You change that to `DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK=0` and run `grab-all-posters` again.  Nothing new will be downloaded since the last run date is now the time of that first run, and nothing has been added to Plex since then.  If you want to grab all posters from the beginning of time for that library, set:
```
DEFAULT_YEARS_BACK=0
RESET_LIBRARIES=Movies
```
That will set the fallback date to "the beginning of time" and apply that new fallback date to the "Movies" library only.
 
If "FIND_OVERLAID_IMAGES" is `1`, the script checks every imnage it downloads for the EXIF tag that indicates PMM created it.  If found, the image is deleted.  You can override the deleting with `RETAIN_PMM_OVERLAID_IMAGES` and/or `RETAIN_TCM_OVERLAID_IMAGES`.

If "RETAIN_PMM_OVERLAID_IMAGES" is `1`, those images with the PMM EXIF tag are **not** deleted.

If "RETAIN_TCM_OVERLAID_IMAGES" is `1`, those images with the PMM EXIF tag are **not** deleted.

If "RETAIN_OVERLAID_IMAGES" is `1`, the previous two settings will be forced to `0` and all overlaid images will be retained.  This is a older deprecated setting.

NOTE: `ONLY_CURRENT` and `POSTER_DEPTH` do not take these images into account, meaning that if you have:
```
ONLY_CURRENT=1
RETAIN_PMM_OVERLAID_IMAGES=0
```
Then nothing will be retained for items with overlaid posters.  `grab-all-posters` will download the current art, find that it has an overlay, delete it, then go to the next movie/show.

Similarly:
```
ONLY_CURRENT=0
POSTER_DEPTH=20
RETAIN_PMM_OVERLAID_IMAGES=0
```
This won't grab images until you have 20 downloaded.  It will grab 20 images, and if ten are found to have overlays, those ten will be deleted and you will end up with 10.

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python grab-all-posters.py`

The posters will be sorted by library [if enabled] with each poster getting an incremented number, like this:

The image names are: `title-source-location-INCREMENT.ext`

`source` is where plex reports it got the image: tmdb, fanarttv, gracenote, etc. This will alaways be "None" for collection images since they are provided by the user or generated [the four-poster ones] by Plex.

`location` will be `local` or `remote` depending whether the URL pointed to the plex server or to some other site like tmdb.

The folder structure in which the images are saved is controlled by a combination of settings; please review the examples below to find the format you want and the settings that you need to generate it.

## image_picker.py

You've run grab-all-posters and now you want a simpler way to choose which of those hundreds of images you want as your active asset

This script does not use anything from the `.env`, but it does make some assumptions:

It presents a web UI that lets you scroll through the images that `grab-all-posters` downloaded, selecting the one you want by clicking on it.

When you click on an image, it is copied to a parallel file system rooted at `active_assets` with the correct pathing and naming for the PMM asset directory.

You can then copy that `active_assets` directory to the PMM config dir ready for use.

It keeps track of which images have been chosen on a show/movie basis [is a json file] so that when you come back the current image is highlighted.

### Assumptions:
1. You are working with a directory of images produced by `grab-all-posters`
2. That directory is named `assets` and is in this directory next to this script.
3. You can run a web server on the machine that listens on port 5001

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python image_picker.py`
3. Go to one of the URLs presented.

In this case I'm running it on a server in my home:
```
python image-picker.py
 * Serving Flask app 'image-picker'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001
 * Running on http://192.168.1.11:5001
 ```
Since I am running it on a machine remote from the laptop I am on, I go to the second URL.

I see a list of my libraries along with a reminder of where images are being read from and copied to:

![image](https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/assets/3865541/f5a0da28-7fef-4e6a-88da-c3778d97726d)

Clicking into the library shows the next level of folders [I have mine split by letter here]:

![image](https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/assets/3865541/08a7747e-dd10-43e9-a63f-b31ff8b4e2b1)

Drilling in displays the movies/shows

![image](https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/assets/3865541/e75be969-0d60-40f0-af91-e595e2199fe1)

Drilling into an individual thing shows the posters for this item, with the filename and image size:

![image](https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/assets/3865541/162ebff9-9aff-4ea4-8c8f-913ff8cb2ec5)

Note that there are checkboxes to show/hide types of images to minimize scrolling, and a slider to control the image size if you need a closer look.

Clicking on an image will copy it to `active_assets` and it is highlighted in the list.

![image](https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/assets/3865541/f08a76ef-42e4-4af4-93d2-9bc7dfd72c5d)

Now that I've chosen a background, I can uncheck "Show Backgrounds" to hide them from the list.  I've also increased the poster size here.

![image](https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/assets/3865541/93b5bbcf-6676-46a9-adc5-4955737d7e8f)

And again, clicking on the image selects and copies.

![image](https://github.com/chazlarson/Media-Scripts/assets/3865541/f95cebd8-e5f3-499b-bfcf-ac2a1f36def4)


At this point if you go look in the file system you'll see:
```
active_assets/Movies/
└── 3
    └── 300 (2007) {imdb-tt0416449} {tmdb-1271}
        ├── background.jpg
        └── poster.jpg
```

TV works the same way except that there are also Season and Episode images.

## grab-all-status.py

Perhaps you want to move or restore watch status from one server to another [or to a rebuild]

This script will retrieve all watched items for all libraries on a given plex server.  It stores them in a tab-delimited file.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```shell
PLEX_OWNER=yournamehere                      # account name of the server owner
```

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python grab-all-status.py`

```shell
Connecting to https://cp1.DOMAIN.TLD...
------------ chazlarson ------------

chazlarson      movie   Movies - 4K     It Comes at Night       2017    R

chazlarson      movie   Movies - 4K DV  Mad Max: Fury Road      2015    R
...
```

The file contains one row per user/library/item:

```shell
chazlarson      movie   Movies - 4K     It Comes at Night       2017    R
chazlarson      movie   Movies - 4K     Mad Max: Fury Road      2015    R
chazlarson      movie   Movies - 4K     Rio     2011    G

chazlarson      movie   Movies - 4K DV  Mad Max: Fury Road      2015    R
...
```

## apply-all-status.py

This script reads the file produces by the previous script and applies the watched status for each user/library/item

Script-specific variables in .env:
```shell
TARGET_PLEX_URL=https://plex.domain2.tld
TARGET_PLEX_TOKEN=PLEX-TOKEN-TWO
TARGET_PLEX_OWNER=yournamehere
LIBRARY_MAP={"LIBRARY_ON_PLEX":"LIBRARY_ON_TARGET_PLEX", ...}
```

These values are for the TARGET of this script; this is easier than requiring you to edit the PLEX_URL, etc, when running the script.

If the target Plex has different library names, you can map one to the other in LIBRARY_MAP.

For example, if the TV library on the source Plex is called "TV - 1080p" and on the target Plex it's "TV Shows on SpoonFlix", you'd map that with:

```
LIBRARY_MAP={"TV - 1080p":"TV Shows on SpoonFlix"}
```
And any records from the status.txt file that came from the "TV - 1080p" library on the source Plex would get applied to the "TV Shows on SpoonFlix" library on the target.

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python apply-all-status.py`

```shell
connecting to https://cp1.DOMAIN.TLD...

------------ Movies - 4K ------------
Searching for It Comes at Night                                                      Marked watched for chazlarson
...
```

There might be a problem with special characters in titles.


## show-all-playlists.py

Perhaps you want to creep on your users and see what they have on their playlists

This script will list the contents of all playlists users have created [except the owner's, since you already have access to those].

Script-specific variables in .env:
```
NONE
```

****

1. setup as above
2. Run with `python show-all-playlists.py`

## delete-collections.py

Perhaps you want to delete all the collections in one or more libraries

This script will simply delete all collections from the libraries specified in the config, except those listed.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```shell
KEEP_COLLECTIONS=bing,bang                      # comma-separated list of collections to keep
```
****
### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python delete-collections.py`

```shell
39 collection(s) retrieved...****
Collection delete - Plex |█████████▎                              | ▂▄▆ 9/39 [23%] in 14s (0.6/s, eta: 27s)
-> deleting: 98 Best Action Movies Of All Time
```

## refresh-metadata.py

Perhaps you want to refresh metadata in one or more libraries; there are situations where refreshing the whole library doesn't work so you have to do it in groups, which can be tiring.

This script will simply loop through the libraries specified in the config, refreshing each item in the library.  It waits for the specified DELAY between each.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```
NONE
```
****
### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python refresh-metadata.py`

```shell
getting items from [TV Shows - 4K]...
looping over 1086 items...
[========================================] 100.1% ... Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist - DONE

getting items from [ TV Shows - Anime]...
looping over 2964 items...
[========================================] 100.0% ... Ōkami Shōnen Ken - DONE
```

## list-item-ids.py

Perhaps you want a list of all the IDs of everything in your libraries or collections.

This script wil output this data into its log file:
```
on 0: INFO: 11/05/2023 05:03:04 PM This collection is called New Episodes
on 0: INFO: 11/05/2023 05:03:05 PM Collection: New Episodes item     1/  125 | TVDb ID: 411029    | IMDb ID: tt15320362  | All the Light We Cannot See

or

```

env vars are the same as grab-all-posters.py for the most part [where they apply], except for:
```
INCLUDE_COLLECTION_MEMBERS=0
ONLY_COLLECTION_MEMBERS=0
```

Which probably do about what you'd expect.

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python list-item-ids.py`

## actor-count.py

Perhaps you want a list of actors with a count of how many movies from your libraries they have been in.

This script connects to a plex library, and grabs all the items.  For each item, it then gets the cast from TMDB and keeps track across all items how many times it sees each actor within the list, looking down to a configurable depth.  For TV libraries, it's pulling the cast at the show level, and I haven't yet done any research to see if guest stars from individual episodes show up in that list.

At the end, it produces a list of a configurable size in descending order of number of appearances.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```
CAST_DEPTH=20                   ### HOW DEEP TO GO INTO EACH MOVIE CAST
TOP_COUNT=10                    ### PUT THIS MANY INTO THE FILE AT THE END
KNOWN_FOR_ONLY=0                   ### ONLY CONSIDER CAST MEMBERS "KNOWN FOR" ACTING
BUILD_COLLECTIONS=0             # build yaml for PMM config.yml
NUM_COLLECTIONS=20              # this many actors in PMM yaml
MIN_GENDER_NONE = 5             # include minimum this many "none" gendered actors in the YAML, if possible
MIN_GENDER_FEMALE = 5           # include minimum this many "female" gendered actors in the YAML, if possible
MIN_GENDER_MALE = 5             # include minimum this many "male" gendered actors in the YAML, if possible
MIN_GENDER_NB = 5               # include minimum this many "non-binary" gendered actors in the YAML, if possible
```

`CAST_DEPTH` is meant to prevent some journeyman character actor from showing up in the top ten; I'm thinking of someone like Clint Howard who's been in the cast of many movies, but I'm guessing when you think of the top ten actors in your library you're not thinking about Clint.  Maybe you are, though, in which case set that higher.

`TOP_COUNT` is the number of actors to show in the list at the end.

Every person in the cast list has a "known_for_department" attribute on TMDB.  If you set `KNOWN_FOR_ONLY=True`, then people who don't have "Acting" in that field will be excluded.  Turning this on may slightly distort results.  For example, Harold Ramis is the second lead in "Stripes" and "Ghostbusters", but he is primarily known for "Directing" according to TMDB, so if you turn this flag on he doesn't get counted at all.

`BUILD_COLLECTIONS` will make the script build some YAML to paste into your Plex-Meta-Manager config file to generate collections.

`NUM_COLLECTIONS` controls the number of collections in that YAML

`TRACK_GENDER` controls whether the script pays attention to actor gender

`MIN_GENDER_*` control the minimum number of that gender [as recorded by TMDB] actor to include in the list [provided `TRACK_GENDER=1`]

Actors are sorted into lists by the four genders recorded at TMDB.  The top `MIN_GENDER_*` for each are added to the final list, then if there is space left over the remainder is filled from the master actor list.

If the four `MIN_GENDER_*` sum to more than `NUM_COLLECTIONS`, the script exists with an error.
### Usage
1. setup as above
1. Run with `python actor-count.py`

```shell
connecting to https://plex.bing.bang...
getting items from [Movies - 4K DV]...
Completed loading 1996 items from Movies - 4K DV
looping over 1996 items...
[======----------------------------------] 15.0% ... Captain America: Civil War    
```

It will go through all your movies, and then at the end print out however many actors you specified in TOP_COUNT along with a bunch of other statistics.

Sample results for the library above:

CAST_DEPTH=20
TOP_COUNT = 10
```shell
30      Samuel L. Jackson - 2231
22      Idris Elba - 17605
22      Tom Hanks - 31
21      Woody Harrelson - 57755
21      Gary Oldman - 64
21      Tom Cruise - 500
21      Morgan Freeman - 192
21      Sylvester Stallone - 16483
20      Willem Dafoe - 5293
20      Laurence Fishburne - 2975
```

CAST_DEPTH=40
TOP_COUNT=10
```shell
33      Samuel L. Jackson - 2231
24      John Ratzenberger - 7907
23      Tom Hanks - 31
22      Bruce Willis - 62
22      Gary Oldman - 64
22      Idris Elba - 17605
22      Morgan Freeman - 192
21      Woody Harrelson - 57755
21      Fred Tatasciore - 60279
21      Tom Cruise - 500
```

Note that the top ten changed dramatically due to looking deeper into the cast lists.

## crew-count.py

Perhaps you want a list of crew members with a count of how many movies from your libraries they have been credited in.

This script connects to a plex library, and grabs all the items.  For each item, it then gets the crew from TMDB and keeps track across all items how many times it sees each individual with the configured `TARGET_JOB` within the list, looking down to a configurable depth.  
At the end, it produces a list of a configurable size in descending order of number of appearances.

Script-specific variables in .env:
```
CREW_DEPTH=20                   ### HOW DEEP TO GO INTO EACH MOVIE CREW
CREW_COUNT=100                  ### HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS TO REPORT AT THE END
TARGET_JOB=Director             ### WHAT JOB TO TRACK
SHOW_JOBS=0                     ### Display a list of all the jobs the script saw
```

`CREW_DEPTH` is meant to allow the script to look deeper into the crew to find all the individuals working as TARGET_JOB.  

`CREW_COUNT` is the number of individuals to show in the list at the end.

If `SHOW_JOBS` is set to 1, the script will also output a list of all the jobs it saw, if you want a reference to what may be available.

### Usage
1. setup as above
1. Run with `python crew-count.py`

```shell
connecting to Plex...
getting items from [Test-Movies]...
looping over 35 items...
[=========================================] 102.9% ... Wild Gals of the Naked West   
```

It will go through all your movies, and then at the end print out however many actors you specified in TOP_COUNT along with a bunch of other statistics.

Sample results for the library above:

CREW_DEPTH=20
CREW_COUNT=100
TARGET_JOB=Director
```shell
